# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction - EDA

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a telecom customer dataset to understand the key factors behind customer churn.

---

## 📁 Dataset Information

- **Dataset**: Customer Churn.csv  
- **Source**: [Kaggle - Telco Customer Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)
- **Target Variable**: `Churn` (Yes/No)

---

## 💡 Key Insights

- Overall churn rate is **~26.5%**
- **Senior citizens** churn more (~42%)
- Customers with **month-to-month** contracts churn the most (~45%)
- **Fiber optic users** churn more than DSL users
- **Electronic check** payment method has highest churn
- **Long-tenure**, **multi-service**, and **contract-bound** customers are more loyal

---

## 📊 Visualizations

The notebook includes:
- Bar charts (Contract vs Churn)
- Pie charts (Gender, SeniorCitizen, etc.)
- Histograms (Tenure, Monthly Charges)
- Correlation heatmaps
